# 5LSM0: Neural Networks for Computer Vision

Due to some complications with Github (Going over Git LFS Data bandwith quota) it was not possible to push and pull from my Github repository. 
The commit history does show the main process during this project. The past code is still available, however it is not the final version and contains many unrelavant scripts.
The new version of the code is added to the submitted zip file on Canvas. My apologies for the inconvenience.
